More of an extermination than a war, The Jarcosia military; led by The [[Polaris]], sent the [[Calyptors]] into The southern parts of The [[Ardent Expanse]] and took over the region occupied by [[Marii]] at [[Ridranus]] and its surrounding regions. This led to a heavy distrust of Polaris senators and especially the Calyptors in the following decades, and ultimately led to the arrest of [[Caldrin Voss]], who fell as a scapegoat for the mass war crimes committed during the Jarcosian occupation.
