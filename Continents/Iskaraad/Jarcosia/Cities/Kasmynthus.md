City in [[Jarcosia]]

_____________________

### General Overview

City Name: Kasmynthus
Tagline/Nickname: The Hidetrade 

Geography: Deep Woodland Crossroads
- Approx. 20 sq miles
    
- Estimated Population: 50,000 (like its own isolated culture, separated from the rest of Jarcosia by dense woodlands but still frequented by traders; it has become simultaneously a travelled and isolated city.)
    
- General Density: Moderately dense in central trade hubs, increasingly scattered as it goes outward
---
### Unique Visual Features & City Quirks

- Built into, around, and above the forest floor, utilizing massive living trees for living, carved up  roots for lower bridges and paths, and pressure luminescent netted and silk webbed bridges for upper tree travel between great-trees.
    
- Inner Tree carved stairs interlace the city's elevation levels, lit inside with fireflies. Wood-chimes act as location indicators, different shaped chimes are made from different material and in different shapes in order 
    
- Sunlight filters in patches; the deeper layers are dim and full of bioluminescent mosses and large glow-beetles called [[Ezeroc]]. 
    
- Roads are root-paths, not paved—shaped with druidic growth or natural decay
    
- The edges of Kasmynthus are full of shops, creating a circle around the town in which trade happens, meaning not many actually enter into the city center itself. The outside is full of hollowed dead-wood buildings. 
    
- Wild creatures (some massive) roam just outside city bounds

## Provinces and Districts

### The Tuatha Medulla

- A larger district inside of the largest tree in Kasmynthus, Tuatha-[[Jun]].
- Most residential folk who live here, the interior of the trees with many Elodrium Moths, alighting the way with blues and yellows. Cracks within the sides of the trees lead outward, leading from tree to tree. Largely intimate and spiritual area, almost cut off completely from the chaos outside where permanent denizens of Kasmynthus live their lives.

### The Tangle-Rings

- A series of outer ring roads of marketplaces and taverns that are most traveled by people coming through, a very streamlined area of low sitting fences of roots and the occasional unused staircase upward into the city further and downward into the Glowroot
- Overall designed for quick commerce and travel-through traffics with different trader hubs

### The Fallow Terraces

- Higher canopy districts and wooden circular , home to communal barracks known as The Branch-Dens; many tamed beasts from larger fauna to smaller. Jaguar scouts and Achagoda at the head.
- Suspended hanging gardens and abbeys to the spirit Ealith, and her Mist-Callers live here in communal barracks known as The Branch-Dens.
- Monitors [[Mt Jun-Taal]] in the south and the sky migrations of [[Camastos]] from Oenata to the mountains.
	- Prominent Buildings
		- The Horned Perch: The watch post that signals beast migration in the surrounding woodlands and sends alerts and wind through the carved chimes of Kasmynthus to delineate danger levels of surrounding fauna. Led by Signaler Torran, a Jarcosian who is also a cartographer.
		- The Branch-Dens: Communal barracks lit by fireflies where many of the Mist-Callers stay

### The Glowroots

- The lower, darker undergrowth of Kasmynthus where one will find hidden corners, rogue's dens, and smugglers of flora.
- Also home to tribes that have semi-integrated into the city but keep their ancestral rites and traditions. Largely lit by bio-luminescent [[Ezeroc]] beetles who rest down here and feed upon the rich nutritious soil from the roots of Tuatha-Jun.
