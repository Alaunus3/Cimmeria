Visual Features and Quirks:

- Entire city sits on basalt growth giving the grass a dark velvet look that grows off of it near the docks.
    
- The wind carries a low humming at night through the basalt pores under the port, creating a series of whistles
    
- Faint glowspores drift north from the canopies and settle on buildings like snowfall
    
- Shimmering, tall pale blade grasses scatter across the land—called “Moonblades”—rumored to sing when trampled
    
- Statues of ancient colossi half-buried in the waters below can be seen from the port edge, eternally watching the sea
