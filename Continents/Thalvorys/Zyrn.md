An old mage working with [[Ithren Valcoris]] in order to create the perfect being. 

He created The Rune of Zyrn, which can be put on a creature. When a [[Therinoth]] is nearby it, it will become feral and attempt to gather its energy. 

The goal is to destroy whatever creature took its energy to reabsorb it. Force transference to a lower willed creature via Bloodstar magics

They both work under [[Rae'Jann]]
