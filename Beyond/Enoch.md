A [[Herald]]

A [[Husk]] whose body was found in a grand ruin in Thalvorys. Made into a hellish monster by [[Ithren Valcoris]] and [[Zyrn]] as a host for one of the Herald's, Enoch.

From the form of a broken Husk, it absorbed energy as if it had no choice.

The arm of a Khoran, blossoming into a flower.
A shoulder spiraling from plant-life into horns like a Tareskan.
A hollow eye socket with a glowing Eryndar sun burning within it, the other a dim gold by comparison of Devan heritage
Another arm forming Tethyrs touched by Animus, giving them a sickly orange color, forming into a sword tipped with Amerite.
White hair flowing back like an Anomai that fades into a bright red and purple luminescent Jyo'Rashan hair, with a crystal within the center of his chest. 
Jarcosian stone and soul forming around it like an aura 
Extra ribs from Ryvarran heritage sticking out in places it shouldn't 
A small metal crawling across it into a sword
