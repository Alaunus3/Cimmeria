Oh Aeon, Prometheus would be envious.

Aeon is an [[Idol]] and the first being made. It may be more accurate to say he is THE Idol. Aeon was created by The Architect at The Great Forge. 

Aeon worked at his forge as he was foretold that a great power would come from outside the Aellorium, and he was to build its defender, The Great Stag. 

While creating The Great Stag, before The Second Sun, before magic, Aeon was found by a woman named [[Ikeshia]]. Ikeshia befriended Aeon. Aeon was joyful to have someone to talk to. Aeon allowed Ikeshia to use his forge in order to search for Legion. Ikeshia eventually told Aeon about what lies outside of The Aellorium, in The Beyond. What dangers the world would face, and offers to be her first champion. He grants her magic to help, gets punished by The Architect, Markus Von Raikan, and is shattered in base elemental forms. 

The Second Sun came after Aeon's fall, but the stag still did its job.
