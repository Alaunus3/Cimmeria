Morikai is the [[Idol]] that the Vantari gain their abilities from, he previously held domain over the Oceans and the Blank, his blood filled the Blank until Vehemence ate it into nothing. However within The Blank, another Essentia, it just caused it to devour anything that fell into its waters.

When his blood coated the oceans it gave the [[Vantari]] the ability to flicker across the [[Veilfire]] (into space) and into the vast nothingness of the [[Blank]].
