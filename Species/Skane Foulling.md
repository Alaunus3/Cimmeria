Creatures originating from the [[Essentia]] of [[Span]]. Skane Foulling are a type of [[Spanstealer]]. Creatures that exist from the loss of Span, via pre mature death.

They have a haunting name as "Span Stealers", but upon further research they themselves do not steal the Span of a mortal. They are merely created by acts that steal Span.
