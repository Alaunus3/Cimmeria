A construct type created by [[Rome Navi]] and used to take over other's appearances by consuming their body in gold via a 'bath' that must be made as a prerequisite. Obake normally carry around dangerous weapons known as Crisis Shiv which can paralyze their target. Crisis Shiv can hide inside of their body and most Obake are unrecognizable until cut, in which they bleed Gold. This is an exception for [[The Gems]]
