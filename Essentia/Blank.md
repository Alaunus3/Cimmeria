Twin [[Essentia]] to [[Tapestry]]

The Blank is outer space, for clarity. But not really. Lets dive in. 

The Blank is a young Essentia. It was originally created on top of the Tapestry in order to act as a tunnel to the [[Idol]] Planes outside of the [[Travelers]], beyond their Veils. 

Issues persisted in this however, for roughly 20,000 years. After Aeon's corruption, Pre Second Sun, he was set to shut off the Idols. In doing this, he repeatedly reset their creations. Creatures that were meant to pass on instead reincarnated.

The Blank is eventually fixed and the Idols gain access once again to their creations; however the reincarnation is not. 

Cycles continue, as with his entire power, through multiple instances of [[Transference]], [[Aeon]] forces mortals to reincarnate.
