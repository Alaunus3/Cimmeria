Twin [[Essentia]] to [[Vehemence]] 

 The Veilfire surrounds many of the [[Travelers]] and interrupts many teleportation spells. The Veilfire also acts as the atmosphere for Cimmeria. Different planets have different veils. Some are more and less dense. Dependent on how dense the Veilfire is, depends on how much [[Divine]] energy is upon that world. 

For example, Cimmeria has a very thin veil and very commonly through history have creatures interacted with Idols and things beyond the veil, within the land of the Gods. 

However, [[Arcadia]] has a much thicker veil, and its extremely rare for Divine magic to be found.
