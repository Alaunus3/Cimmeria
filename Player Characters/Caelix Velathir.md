[[Player Character]]

Ithren Valcoris: We've got a project, we're making the perfect being. All of the best from every race. It would have so many uses to advance us.

Things keep getting in the way, every race has standouts. And theres very few ways to harvest the raw Transference of someone. 

A Ryvarran that can tethyr to a location in seconds
A Jyo'Rasha tied to an ancient Wyvern
A human with rage in its blood
So many

There exist creatures who can harvest these abilities, much better than us mortals. Sending them to each and every location. Worthy, glorious sacrifices.

That's why it pains me so much that you took that rune off your neck, Caelix.

I really wanted you to pass peacefully. Your focus is just too strong to ignore.
