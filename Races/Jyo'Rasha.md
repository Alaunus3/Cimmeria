The Jyo'Rasha are a [[Race]] that utilize Transference in order to hollow out the [[Soul]] of [[Wyvern]]s. They reincarnate through these souls, gaining Embodiment personality traits of the Wyvern. In some cases a Jyo'Rasha may even gain power based on the domain of the Wyvern. This gives some members of this race a theoretically infinite [[Span]] and biological immortality.

Their homeland of [[Dhegoval]] is in [[Thalvorys]]. Their leader is Bolan, High Vessel of The Hollow Sky
